Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

# My Solution

### Time Taken

\> 30m

### Method

- I could figure out that we need to do counting and then sorting, but couldn't find out how to do sorting in a linear time...
  - I did count in O(n) just by using hash table and iterating like I did before in another problem.

### Time Complexity

- O(n log n)
  - Since I couldn't came up with solutions to do sorting in a linear time even thought I did counting in O(n)

# What I didn't know

## Other Solutions

- Bucket Sort: O(n)
  - Make buckets for elements and then insert each elements.
    - In this problem, we use 2-demensional array: use an index as counter, and arrays to store each numbers.
      - For example, if the number `3` and `5` appeared twice in the given `nums`, `bucket_array[2]=[3, 5]`.
      - This is possible since the length of `nums` is finite: we should make `n + 1` sized array for the case where every numbers in `nums` are same so that the counter value is same as the length of `nums`.
  - And then walk the buckets in reverse to collect top `k` frequent elements.
    - This also takes just O(n).

## Python Grammar

- Iterate an array in reversed order: `for i in range(len(target_array) - 1, 0, -1)`
