# Problem

49. Group Anagrams
    Medium
    Array, Hash Table, String, Sorting

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

# My Solution

### Time Taken

= 15m

### Method

- Hash Table + Sorting
  - Iterating the array, gather each elements together when they can are anagrams.
    - Before inserting the element into the hash table, we need to do sorting so that we can find out anagrams.
  - At the last, we can simply return the values of the hash table.

### Time Complexity

- O(n)
  - Since we need to iterate over the given array
  - Sorting and finding the key are done in O(1).

# What I didn't know

## Other Solutions

## Python Grammar

- Get every values of dictionary and convert it into an array: `list(target_dictionary.value())`
- Append an element to an array: `target_list.append(target_element)`
- Sort every characters in a string and keep the type as the same: `''.join(sorted(target_string))`
- Initialize the hash map with default value as list: `defaultdict(list)`
