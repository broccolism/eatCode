# Problem

167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
     Medium
     Array, Two Pointers, Binary Search

Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

# My Solution

### Time Taken

\> 30m

### Method

- Brute force.. which lead me to the time out...
- I've came up with that we need to do something with the array has been sorted already, but could't find out how and what to do.

### Time Complexity

- O(n^2)
  - Since...

# What I didn't know

## Other Solutions

- Two pointer: O(n)
  - Each pointer begins to travel from the start and the end of the array
    - Untill finding the answer, move left pointer by one if the target is larger than current sum, move right otherwise.
    - I couldn't think about moving 2 pointers. I was just thinking about mvoing the right pointer only, which takes too much time.
