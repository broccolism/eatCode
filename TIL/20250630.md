# Problem

594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence
     Easy
     Array, Hash Table, Sliding Window, Sorting, Counting

We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.

Given an integer array nums, return the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.

# My Solution

### Time Taken

< 20m

### Method

- Using hash table
  - First, count all elements. Store counts into the hash table, (key, value) = (num, count)
  - Second, iterating the keys and check if there's smaller or bigger than current number
  - Third, combine their length

### Time Complexity

- O(n)
  - Since we iterate the array and hash table
  - Lookup in hashtable only takes O(1)

# What I didn't know

## Other Solutions

- Sort and use sliding window
  - I've came up with sorting and counting continously adding the index, but couldn't figure out how to count the length with previous elements iterating over the array from the first to end: which is, 'sliding window'
  - Sliding window by using 2 pointers
    - Just use 2 pointers, first one for the start of the sequence and another for the end of the sequence.
    - During the iteration, we just need to memo the index where the value gets different and then use it as a new starting pointer.

## Python Grammar

- Iterate keys in dictionary: `for key in target_hashtable`
