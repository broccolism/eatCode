# Problem

11. Container With Most Water
    Medium
    Array, Two Pointers, Greedy

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

# My Solution

### Time Taken

\> 30m

### Method

- I could came up with using two pointer but couldn't think about how to prepare the next loop, AGAIN.

### Time Complexity

- O(n)
  - Since I've used twe pointer normally.

# What I didn't know

## Other Solutions

- How to prepare the next loop: simply keep the higher one and move another.
  - Since the purpose of twe pointer is REMOVING UNNECESSARY COMPARISIONS.
  - Don't care about when the `height[left]` and `height[right]` are the same, since we can just move any one of it.
