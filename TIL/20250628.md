36. Valid Sudoku
    Normal
    Array, Hash Table, Matrix

Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

# My Solution

### Time Taken

= 30m

### Method

- Brute Force
  - Just check every cases (row, column, sub-boxes)
  - Use an array to memorize which number has been appeared

### Time Complexity

- O(n^2) when n is size of the board
  - Since I need to iterate over all the cells in the board
