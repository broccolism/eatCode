# Problem

20. Valid Parentheses
    Easy
    String, Stack

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

# My Solution

### Time Taken

< 10m

### Method

- Use array as a stack
  - Append when we meet an open bracket
  - Pop when we meet a closing bracket and the last element of array is the same type with it

### Time Complexity

- O(n)
  - Since we need to check all characters in the string.

# What I didn't know

## Other Solutions

## Python Grammar

- Pop the last element from the array: `target_array.pop()`
