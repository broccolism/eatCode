# Problem

128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
     Medium
     Array, Hash Table, Union Find

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

# My Solution

### Time Taken

\> 30m

### Method

- I could came up with
  - that we don't need to store all elements in the sequence,
  - that we cannot use any comparison-based sorting algorithm for the time complexity,
  - that we need to iterate all the given array,
  - that we may use hash table
    - but I thought we need to store (start, end) somewhere.
      - Which every solutions didn't.
      - And it was not necessary to get the answer, too.

### Time Complexity

- O(0)
  - Since I didn't solve

# What I didn't know

## Other Solutions

1. Use hash table very cleverly

- Key is numbers in the given array, value is length of consecutive sequence that the key is either the start or end of the sequence.

2. Use set

- Since looking up in the set only takes O(1), the problem gets very easier after converting the given array to set type.
  - Find the definite start by looking up (start - 1) number from the set
  - We can also looking up next elements from the set with no burden
  - Then, just return the length

## Python Grammar

- Find max value between two : `max(target_1, target_2)`
- Looking up in set only takes: `O(1)`
  - Since: Set uses hash table
- Get value from hash table with default value: `target_map.get(target_key, default_value)`
