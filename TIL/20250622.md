     Array, Hash Table, Sorting

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

# My Solution

### Time Taken

< 5m

### Method

- Type converting
  - Change the given array into Set type and compare the length of set and list.

### Time Complexity

- O(n)
  - Since I need to convert array to set

# What I didn't know

## Other Solutions

- Bruteforce: O(n^2)
  - Since we need to compare each elements one by one
- Sorting: O(n log n)
  - Since we need to sort(O(n log n)) and compare adjacent elements (O(n)).
- Hash Table: O(n)
  - Make a set iterating each element and compare if it already exists in the set.

## Python Grammar

- Change list type to set: `set(targetList)`
- Get the size of list and set: `len(targetSet)`, `len(targetList)`
