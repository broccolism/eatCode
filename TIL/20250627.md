# Problem

238. Product of Array Except Self
     Medium
     Array, Prefix Sum

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

# My Solution

Made 3 solutions.

### Time Taken

= 15m
= 15m
= 15m

### Method

1. O(n) but with division: Get product of all numbers and divide (need to consider zeros.)
1. O(n) without division but O(n) more spaces: Get every prefix and suffix products first, and combine
1. O(n) without division and only with O(1) more spaces: Iterate over the result array, compute for each index using accumulator and repeat it in the reversed order.

### Time Complexity

- O(n)
  - Since I've used only iterating.

# What I didn't know

## Other Solutions

## Python Grammar

- 3 operand operator: `does not exist. use if statement instead: (value_when_true) if (condition) else (value_when_false)`
