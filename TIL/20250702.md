    Array, Two Pointers, Sorting

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

# My Solution

### Time Taken

= 30m

### Method

- 2 pointer
  - Fix the left, use 2-pointer algorithm with mid and right pointer.

### Time Complexity

- O(n^2)
  - Since we do scan all the array for each `left` pointer.

# What I didn't know

## Other Solutions

- How to keep going using 2 pointer
  - Increase left pointer, and decrease right pointer --> this ends the while loop.

## Python Grammar

- Add a new element to the set: `target_set.add(target_element)`
- Initialize a set: `set()`
- Make a tulple: `(1, 2, 3, ..., last)`
