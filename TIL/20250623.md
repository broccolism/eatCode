# Problem

242. Valid Anagram
     Easy
     Hash Table, String, Sorting

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

# My Solution

### Time Taken

< 5m

### Method

- Sort and compare
  - Sort 2 lists and return if elements in each lists with same index are different iterating from 0 to the length of lists.

### Time Complexity

- O(n log n)
  - Since I need to sort lists.

# What I didn't know

- Hash Table: O(n)
  - Iterate over the given strings while incrementing the value started from 0, **using the value of the character as an index**.
    - For example, `count[char] = 1 + count[char]`
    - Since we only need to iterate 2 strings, it takes O(n).
- Split string to list and compare: O(n)
  - In Python, we don't need to manually iterate over and count. We can simply use Counter.

## Other Solutions

## Python Grammar

- Sort the given list and return the result: `sorted(targetList)`
- Sort and compare all the elements in given arrays: `sorted(s)==sorted(t)`
- Count each element's appearance in array: `Counter(targetList)`
